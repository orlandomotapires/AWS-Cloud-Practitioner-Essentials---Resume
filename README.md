## **Module 1 - Introduction to Amazon Web Services**

### **Introduction**

&emsp;The purpose of Module 1 is to introduce the concept of cloud computing

### **The client-server model**

&emsp;A client-server model is a model based on client request and server response. You can think of a client as a person who wants to buy a coffee and server as the coffee shop selling it. The person asks for a coffee to the attendant and he go get the coffee and bring back to the person, a similar process occurs when a client asks for something for the server.

### **Cloud Computing**

&emsp;A short definition could be "The on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing", the concept of cloud computing is the idea of heaving a independent server to store all the data a client would ever need. The main thing about cloud is the fact the client do not need to worry about having to deal with having a big room to store all the server machines and a whole IT team to manage them.</br>
&emsp;As well, the client only pays for the resources that he is using, when he is using, it means in the moment that he stops, he is not going to pay for it. </br>
&emsp;In general, when a client needs to store some data it is just necessary that the buy the amount of space he need at that moment and that is it, no need to worry about guessing the space it is going to be necessary on the future. </br>
&emsp;Lastly, the most beautiful thing about cloud-computing is the flexibility. While a client need, for example, a hundred servers, he can continue using it until he do not need then anymore, so he can just press a few clicks and return then to AWS, not needing to pay for them anymore. The other side can also happen, if the client need more servers he can just start using them without needing to warn the server-side before.

#### **Deployment models for cloud computing**

&emsp;When a costumer wants to migrate their application in cloud, there will be different approaches for each system in deployment process, based on the peculiarities for their system. Thus, there are three types(models) cloud computing deployments.

- Cloud-based deployment:</br>
&emsp;In cloud-based deployments models, you will run all parts of the application in the cloud, as so, you can migrate existing applications to the cloud or build and design new applications.</br>
&emsp;Therefore, your application can use virtual servers, database and networking components fully allocated and managed by AWS servers, based on cloud computing.

- On-premises deployment:</br>
&emsp;In On-premises deployments models, also know by  private cloud deployment, the costumer will deploy only their own resources, live physical servers for example, into cloud, in that way, he will be able to use cloud resource management tools to increase resource utilization.</br>
&emsp;This model is used when the costumer has an legacy IT infrastructure, therefore, he cant migrate all parts of the application to the cloud, like the cloud-based deployment.</br>
&emsp;The advantage of this type of model, is that the costumer will outsource all resource management from his own responsibility, increase resource utilization, based on application management and virtualization technologies.</br>
- Hybrid deployment:</br>
&emsp;In Hybrid deployments models, as the name suggests, will connect cloud based resources to on-premises infrastructure.</br>
&emsp;This model usually is used when, for example, due to government regulations require your business to keep certain records on premises. In this model, some parts of the application are on cloud and others, don't.</br>

#### **Benefits of cloud computing**

- Trade up front expense for variable expense: </br>
&emsp;Upfront expense refers to data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest in before using them. Variable expense means you only pay for computing resources you consume instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them. </br>
&emsp;By taking a cloud computing approach that offers the benefit of variable expense, companies can implement innovative solutions while saving on costs. </br>

- Stop Spending Money to run and maintain data centers: </br>
&emsp;As said before, when using cloud-computing to store data, the client do not need to worry about maintaining a whole data center working. In this way, being able to focus on what really matters. </br>

- Stop Guessing capacity:</br>
&emsp; With cloud computing, you don’t have to predict how much infrastructure capacity you will need before deploying an application.</br>

- Benefit from massive economies of scale:</br>
&emsp; Due to the usage from hundreds of thousands of customers, cloud-computing became cheaper then on-premises deployment. Therefore, AWS cloud services can achieve higher economies of scale.</br>

- Increase speed and agility:</br>
&emsp;The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier for you to develop and deploy applications. By comparison, cloud computing enables you to access new resources within minutes.</br>

- Go global in minutes:</br>
&emsp; You can use AWS global infrastructure to deploy your cloud-based application in all local in the world, with low latency and just some clicks.</br>
